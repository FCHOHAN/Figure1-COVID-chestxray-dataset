We are building this dataset as a part of the COVIDx dataset to enhance our models for COVID-19 detection (COVID-Net) and COVID-19 risk stratification (COVID-RiskNet):
* COVID-Net: https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net
* COVID-RiskNet: coming soon

Please see the main COVID-Net repo for details on data extraction and instructions for creating the full COVIDx dataset.
